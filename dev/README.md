# What

This is a scratch pad to facilitate creating the notebooks.
It's useful for creating a rough draft of what will go into the notebook
and to debug any issues that might come. Be sure to add the .venv folder
to the interpreter for your IDE.

# Notebook

When testing notebooks, you'll come across inputs that you must give (E.g., authentication inputs).
Before committing, be sure to go to Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs of All Cells -> Save (Ctrl + S on Windows).
This way we aren't committing any secrets.
