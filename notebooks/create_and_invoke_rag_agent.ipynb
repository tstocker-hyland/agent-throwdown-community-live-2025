    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent** using the Hyland Agent Platform API. You'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authenticate** with the Hyland API using OAuth 2.0 client credentials\n",
    "2. **Configure** a RAG agent with specific parameters\n",
    "3. **Create** the agent via REST API calls\n",
    "4. **Understand** the response and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Valid Hyland client credentials (`CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`)\n",
    "- Basic understanding of REST APIs and JSON\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python (helpful but not required)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. **Run cells sequentially** from top to bottom\n",
    "2. **Read the explanations** before each code section\n",
    "3. **Enter your credentials** when prompted (they will be hidden)\n",
    "4. **Check the output** after each cell execution\n",

Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee\\'s straight-time pay rate \\\\(as of the date of the holiday\\\\) times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day. Eligible employee classification\\\\(s\\\\): Regular full-time employees   If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee\\'s paid absence \\\\(e.g., vacation, sick leave\\\\), the employee will be ineligible for holiday pay. If eligible nonexempt employees work on a recognized holiday, they will receive holiday pay plus wages at their straight-time rate for the hours worked on the holiday. In addition to the recognized holidays previously listed, eligible employees will receive two floating holidays in each anniversary year. To be eligible, employees must complete three calendar days of service in an eligible employment classification. These holidays must be scheduled with the prior approval of the employee\\'s supervisor. Paid time off for holidays will be counted as hours worked for the purposes of determining whether overtime pay is owed.   3-06 Workers\\' Compensation Insurance   Hyland Industries provides a comprehensive workers\\' compensation insurance program at no cost to employees, pursuant to law. This program covers any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to applicable legal requirements, workers\\' compensation insurance provides benefits after a short waiting period or, if the employee is hospitalized, immediately.   Employees who sustain work-related injuries or illnesses should inform their supervisor immediately. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. This will enable an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible.   3-07 Sick Leave Benefits   Hyland Industries provides paid sick leave benefits to all eligible employees for periods of temporary absence due to illnesses or injuries. Eligible employee classification\\\\(s\\\\): Regular full-time employees   Eligible employees will accrue sick leave benefits at the rate of 10 days per year \\\\(.83 of a day for every full month of service\\\\). Sick leave benefits are calculated on the basis of a \"benefit year,\" the 12-month period that begins when the employee starts to earn sick leave benefits. Paid sick leave can be used in minimum increments of one day. An eligible employee may use sick leave benefits for an absence due to his or her own illness or injury, or that of a child, parent, or spouse of the employee.   Employees who are unable to report to work due to illness or injury should notify their direct supervisor before the scheduled start of their workday if possible. The direct supervisor must also be contacted on each additional day of absence. If an employee is absent for three or more consecutive days due to illness or injury, the Hyland Industries may require a physician\\'s statement verifying the illness or injury and its beginning and expected ending dates. Such \\n\\n verification may be requested for other sick leave absences as well and may be required as a condition to receiving sick leave benefits.   Sick leave benefits will be calculated based on the employee\\'s base pay rate at the time of absence and will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials.   Sick leave benefits are intended solely to provide income protection in the event of illness or injury, and may not be used for any other absence. Unused sick leave benefits will not be paid to employees while they are employed or upon termination of employment.   3-08 Time Off to Vote   Hyland Industries encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by participating in elections. Generally, employees are able to find time to vote either before or after their regular work schedule. If employees are unable to vote in an election during their nonworking hours, Hyland Industries will grant up to two hours of paid time off to vote.   Employees should request time off to vote from their supervisor at least two working days prior to the Election Day. Advance notice is required so that the necessary time off can be scheduled at the beginning or end of the work shift, whichever causes less disruption to the normal work schedule.   Employees must submit a voter\\'s receipt on the first working day following the election to qualify for paid time off.   3-09 Bereavement Leave   Employees who wish to take time off due to the death of an immediate family member should notify their supervisor immediately.   Up to three days of paid bereavement leave will be provided to eligible employees in the following classification\\\\(s\\\\):   Regular full-time employees   Bereavement pay is calculated based on the base pay rate at the time of absence and will not include any special forms of compensation, such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials.   Bereavement leave will normally be granted unless there are unusual business needs or staffing requirements. Employees may, with their supervisors\\' approval, use any available paid leave for additional time off as necessary.   Hyland Industries defines \"immediate family\" as the employee\\'s spouse, parent, child, or sibling. 3-11 Jury Duty   Hyland Industries encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when required. Employees may request unpaid jury duty leave for the length of absence. If desired, employees may use any available paid time off \\\\(for example, vacation benefits\\\\). Employees must show the jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that the supervisor may make arrangements to accommodate their absence. Of course, employees are expected to report for work whenever the court schedule permits.', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'class_name': 'TextNode'}, 'score': 0.0008295892039313912, 'class_name': 'NodeWithScore'}, {'node': {'id_': 'f4b8d0f6-a888-4b76-9150-010428de8220', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'object_id': '05ebc550-8fb0-46bf-9884-f41f1e1b7a44', 'chunk_id': '27e1773a-42d7-46e6-ba81-c0064e9de9eb'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'text': \"# Hyland Industries Employee Handbook 2023\\n Employees who wish to review their own file should contact the Human Resources Department. With reasonable advance notice, employees may review their own personnel files in Hyland Industries's offices and in the presence of an individual appointed by Hyland Industries to maintain the files.   2-04 Personal Data Changes   It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify Hyland Industries of any changes in personal data. Personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of an emergency, educational accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personal data has changed, notify the Human Resources Department.   2-05 Introductory Period   The introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. Hyland Industries uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. Either the employee or Hyland Industries may end the employment relationship at will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice.   All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for the first 90 calendar days after their date of hire. Any significant absence will automatically extend an introductory period by the length of the absence. If Hyland Industries determines that the designated introductory period does not allow sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may be extended for a specified period.   2-08 Employment Applications   Hyland Industries relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may result in the exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment. In processing employment applications, Hyland Industries may obtain a consumer credit report or background check for employment. If Hyland Industries takes an adverse employment action based in whole or in part on any report caused by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a copy of the report and a summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act will be provided as well as any other documents required by law.   2-09 Performance Evaluation   Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. A formal written performance evaluation will be conducted following an employee's introductory period. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both supervisors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals.   2-10 Job Descriptions \\n\\n Hyland Industries maintains job descriptions to aid in orienting new employees to their jobs, identifying the requirements of each position, establishing hiring criteria, setting standards for employee performance evaluations, and establishing a basis for making reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.   The Human Resources Department and the hiring manager prepare job descriptions when new positions are created. Existing job descriptions are also reviewed and revised in order to ensure that they are up to date. Job descriptions may also be rewritten periodically to reflect any changes in position duties and responsibilities. All employees will be expected to help ensure that their job descriptions are accurate and current, reflecting the work being done. Employees should remember that job descriptions do not necessarily cover every task or duty that might be assigned, and that additional responsibilities may be assigned as necessary. Contact the Human Resources Department if you have any questions or concerns about your job description.   3-01 Employee Benefits   Eligible employees at Hyland Industries are provided a wide range of benefits. A number of the programs \\\\(such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability, and unemployment insurance\\\\) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law.   Benefits eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. Your supervisor can identify the programs for which you are eligible. Details of many of these programs can be found elsewhere in the Handbook.   The following benefit programs are available to eligible employees:   \\uf0b7 auto mileage   \\uf0b7 bereavement leave   \\uf0b7 dental insurance   \\uf0b7 holidays   \\uf0b7 medical insurance   \\uf0b7 stock options   \\uf0b7 vacation benefits   Some benefit programs require contributions from the employee, but most are fully paid by Hyland Industries Many benefits are described in separate Summary Plan Descriptions, or Plans, which may change from time to time. The Summary Plan Description will have control over any policy in this Handbook. You will receive a copy of each Summary Plan Description applicable to you.

Employees requesting family leave related to the serious health condition of a child, spouse, or parent may be required to submit a health care provider\\'s statement verifying the need for family leave to provide care, its beginning and expected ending dates, and the estimated time required. Eligible employees may request up to a maximum of 12 weeks of family leave within any 12- month period. Any combination of family leave and medical leave may not exceed this maximum. Married employee couples may be restricted to a combined total of 12 weeks leave within any 12-month period for childbirth, adoption, or placement of a foster child or to care for a parent with a serious health condition.   Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, Hyland Industries will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full period of the approved family leave. Benefit accruals, such as vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits, will continue during the approved family leave period.   So that an employee\\'s return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on family leave is requested to provide Hyland Industries with at least two weeks\\' advance notice of the date the employee intends to return to work. When a family leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same position, if it is available, or to an equivalent position for which the employee is qualified. If an employee fails to return to work on the agreed-upon return date, Hyland Industries will assume that the employee has resigned.   6-07 Pregnancy Disability Leave   Hyland Industries provides pregnancy disability leaves of absence without pay to eligible employees who are temporarily unable to work due to a disability related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Any employee is eligible to request pregnancy disability leave as described in this policy. Employees should make requests for pregnancy disability leave to their supervisors at least 30 days in advance of foreseeable events and as soon as possible for unforeseeable events. A health care provider\\'s statement must be submitted verifying the need for pregnancy disability leave and its beginning and expected ending dates. Any changes in this information should be promptly reported to Hyland Industries Employees returning from pregnancy disability leave must submit a health care provider\\'s verification of their fitness to return to work.   Employees are normally granted unpaid leave for the period of the disability, up to a maximum of four months. Employees may substitute any accrued paid leave time for unpaid leave as part of the pregnancy disability leave period. Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of the applicable plans, Hyland Industries will continue to provide health insurance benefits for the full period of the approved pregnancy disability leave. So that an employee\\'s return to work can be properly scheduled, an employee on pregnancy disability leave is requested to provide Hyland Industries with at least two weeks\\' advance notice of the date she intends to return to work. When a pregnancy disability leave ends, the employee will be reinstated to the same position, unless either the employee would not otherwise have been employed for legitimate business \\n\\n reasons or each means of preserving the job would substantially undermine the ability to operate Hyland Industries safely and efficiently. If the same position is not available, the employee will be offered a comparable position in terms of such issues as pay, location, job content, and promotional opportunities.   If an employee fails to report to work promptly at the end of the pregnancy disability leave, Hyland Industries will assume that the employee has resigned.   7-01 Employee Conduct and Work Rules   To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Hyland Industries expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all employees and the organization.   It is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment:   \\uf0b7 Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property   \\uf0b7 Falsification of timekeeping records   \\uf0b7 Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs   \\uf0b7 Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment \\uf0b7 Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace   \\uf0b7 Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace   \\uf0b7 Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of employer-owned or customer-owned property   \\uf0b7 Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct   \\uf0b7 Violation of safety or health rules   \\uf0b7 Smoking in the workplace   \\uf0b7 Sexual or other unlawful or unwelcome harassment   \\uf0b7 Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace   \\uf0b7 Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice   \\uf0b7 Unauthorized disclosure of business \"secrets\" or confidential information \\uf0b7 Violation of personnel policies   \\uf0b7 Unsatisfactory performance or conduct   Nothing is this policy is intended to change the Hyland Industries\\'s at-will employment policy.

To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner.   While on Hyland Industries premises and while conducting business-related activities off Hyland Industries premises, no employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. The legal use of prescribed drugs is permitted on the job only if it does not impair an employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger other individuals in the workplace.   Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment, and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program. Such violations may also have legal consequences.   Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged to discuss these matters with their supervisor or the Human Resources Department to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate resources in the community.   Employees with problems with alcohol and certain drugs that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a rehabilitation or treatment program through Hyland Industries's health insurance benefit coverage. Leave may be granted if the employee agrees to abstain from use of the problem substance and abides by all Hyland Industries policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace; and if granting the leave will not cause Hyland Industries any undue hardship.   Employees with questions on this policy or issues related to drug or alcohol use in the workplace should raise their concerns with their supervisor or the Human Resources Department without fear of reprisal.   7-03 Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment   Hyland Industries is committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination and conduct that can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including sexual harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or any other legally protected characteristic will not be tolerated.   Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. This definition includes many forms of offensive behavior and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same sex as the harasser. The following is a partial list of sexual harassment examples:\", 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'class_name': 'TextNode'}, 'score': 0.0003077430883422494, 'class_name': 'NodeWithScore'}, {'node': {'id_': 'd27581ff-b408-4ced-acd8-9fd107b99adc', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'object_id': '3915f422-219c-448d-8e4b-f9d77c4d12ae', 'chunk_id': '23c28705-3465-4542-b5c3-de6846dd716f'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'text': \"## 2.1 Distribution and Adherence to Handbook Policies\\n\\n This handbook is distributed to all herein, Hyland employees who are required to acknowledge and adhere to the policies.

Vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits will continue to accrue during unpaid jury duty leave. 3-13 Benefits Continuation \\\\(COBRA\\\\)   The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \\\\(COBRA\\\\) gives employees and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage under Hyland Industries\\'s health plan when a \"qualifying event\" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Some common qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; a reduction in an employee\\'s hours or a leave of absence; an employee\\'s divorce or legal separation; and a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at Hyland Industries\\'s group rates plus an administration fee. Hyland Industries provides each eligible employee with a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under Hyland Industries\\'s health insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee\\'s rights and obligations. Contact the Human Resources Department for more information about COBRA.   3-16 Health Insurance   Hyland Industries\\'s health insurance plan provides employees access to medical and dental insurance benefits. Employees in the following employment classification\\\\(s\\\\) are eligible to participate in the health insurance plan:   Regular full-time employees   Eligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan subject to all terms and conditions of the agreement between Hyland Industries and the insurance carrier. A change in employment classification that would result in loss of eligibility to participate in the health insurance plan may qualify an employee for benefits continuation under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \\\\(COBRA\\\\). Refer to the \"Benefits Continuation \\\\(COBRA\\\\)\" policy section 3-13 for more information.   Details of the health insurance plan are described in the Summary Plan Description \\\\(SPD\\\\). An SPD and information on cost of coverage will be provided in advance of enrollment to eligible employees. Contact the Human Resources Department for more information about health insurance benefits.   4-03 Paydays   All employees are paid monthly on the first day of the month. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed through the end of the previous payroll period. In the event that a regularly scheduled payday falls on a day off, such as a weekend or holiday, employees will receive pay on the last day of work before the regularly scheduled payday.', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'class_name': 'TextNode'}, 'score': 0.00019563533714972436, 'class_name': 'NodeWithScore'}, {'node': {'id_': 'a0402234-c8ee-4f68-842e-cbb639a44e90', 'embedding': None, 'extra_info': {'object_id': '3915f422-219c-448d-8e4b-f9d77c4d12ae', 'chunk_id': 'd17dc4cf-7d0c-4ccf-91a4-71ab5c928f62'}, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'relationships': {}, 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'text': '# 2 Employment\\n\\n The task of handling personnel records and related personnel administration functions at Hyland is assigned to the Human Resources department.

In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed an I-9 with Hyland Industries within the past three years or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid. Employees with questions or seeking more information on immigration law issues are encouraged to contact the Human Resources Department. Employees may raise questions or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal.   1-08 Conflicts of Interest   Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which Hyland Industries wishes the business to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction so that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable standards of operation. Contact the Human Resources Department for more information or questions about conflicts of interest.   An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of Hyland Industries\\'s business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage.   No \"presumption of guilt\" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to an officer of Hyland Industries as soon as possible the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.   Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which Hyland Industries does business, but also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving Hyland Industries   1-12 Non-Disclosure   The protection of confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and the success of Hyland Industries Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'start_char_idx': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', 'class_name': 'TextNode'}, 'score': 0.00012339458044152707, 'class_name': 'NodeWithScore'}], 'vector_db': 'N/A'}}\n",
